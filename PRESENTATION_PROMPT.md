## Slide 2: Introduction
- **Problem Statement**: 
  - Real-time task scheduling in IoT-edge-cloud environments.
  - Need for low-latency (<100ms) decisions.
  - Energy efficiency requirements.

## Slide 3: Implemented Components
1. **AI-Driven Task Scheduling**: 
   - ML model for local/cloud decisions.
   - Metrics: CPU load, network speed, priority.
2. **Lightweight Virtualization**:  
   - Docker containerization.
   - Optimized for edge deployment.
3. **Core Resource Allocation**: 
   - CPU/network-aware scheduling.
   - Local vs cloud offloading decisions.

## Slide 4: Future Developments
1. **Reinforcement Learning**: 
   - Transition from static model to DQN.
2. **Kubernetes Orchestration**: 
   - Multi-container deployment.
3. **EdgeCloudSim Integration**:
